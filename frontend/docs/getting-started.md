# Getting Started

## `frontend` directory

This directory contains the frontend part of our application. The frontend is built using React with Vite for development and build tooling.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or Git Bash or WSL on Windows)

### Make the Script Executable

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: If you are on Windows, ensure that you use a Unix-like shell such as Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run the script.
- **Permissions**: `Before running the script for the first time`, you may need to make it executable:

  ```bash
  chmod +x ../run-frontend.sh
  ```

## [Run the Project](./run-frontend.md)
